  disclaimer1: 'This application is designed to screen for FAS(D) and make it easier for treating individuals to identify FASD and initiate a diagnosis.\n' +
    'It does not replace a diagnosis. The results should be evaluated by the attending physician or psychologist.',
  disclaimer2: 'By using the application, you confirm that patients or their proxies have consented to participate in screening and to have medical data analyzed anonymously in an algorithmic manner.\n',
  disclaimer3: 'Every test procedure has a small probability of error, i.e. false-positive (healthy patient is detected as affected) and false-negative (present case is not detected) assessments may occur.\n',

  more_info_text: 'FAS is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The definition of the FAS has changed little since the 1970â€™s when the condition was first described and refined. The condition has been broadly characterized by prenatal and/or postnatal growth deficiency, a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies, and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. FAS is the leading known cause of mental retardation/developmental disabilities in the Western World and is entirely preventable. The prevalence of FAS is estimated to be 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births in the general population, but has been documented to be as high as 10 to 15 per 1,000 in some high-risk populations. The physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure are not dichotomous, that is either normal or clearly abnormal. Rather, the outcomes, and the prenatal alcohol exposure, all range along separate continua from normal to clearly abnormal and distinctive. This full range of outcomes observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure has come to be called Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). The term FASD is not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis. A patient would not receive adiagnosis of FASD, for the term is too broadly defined to be of clinical value. FAS, on the other hand, is a clinical diagnosis and is one of several alcohol-related diagnoses that fall under the umbrella of FASD.\n',
